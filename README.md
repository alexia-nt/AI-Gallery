# 3D Interactive Art Gallery

An immersive **WebGL 3D art gallery** built with **Three.js**, featuring walkable navigation, interactive 3D sculptures, artwork modals, ambient sound, and collision detection.

Users can freely explore the virtual gallery, view artworks, and interact with sculptures by clicking on them.

**The Question:** Can you find the secret easter egg hidden somewhere in the gallery? Only the most observant visitors will discover this!
